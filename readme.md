## Server-Side Calculator

In this challenge, I created a calculator interface that can accept any two numbers and add, subtract, multiply or divide them.  The numbers get stored in an object on the client side, then are posted to the server for calculation.  The server sends back the result, which displays for the user on the DOM.
